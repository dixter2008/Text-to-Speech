                <strong>About This Project:</strong><br><br>
                LUISIANO is a student-friendly Text-to-Speech tool that also summarizes 
                written text. Designed to help learners who prefer to listen instead of read, 
                this web app makes studying easier and more accessible. It’s especially useful
                for auditory learners or those who want quick summaries of long content. 
                This website is part of our research project as Computer Programming students. 
                Our goal is to develop a useful tool that supports auditory learning and improves 
                access to information through text-to-speech and summarization features. 
                This project demonstrates our skills in web development, user experience design, 
                and real-world problem-solving.
